// blinking led
// just start reading Simply AVR yesterday
//, i still can't write a code that change led intesity
//but here is what i've learn until today :)


#define F_CPU 1000000Ul // a must-write line

//calling libraries
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/delay.h>

int main (void) {
   DDRD = 0B00000001; // setting PD0 as an output
   while(1){
   PORTD = 0B00000001; // pin D0 is high
   _delay_ms(1000);
   PORTD = 0B00000000 // pin D0 is low
   _delay_ms(1000);
   }
return 0 ;
}
